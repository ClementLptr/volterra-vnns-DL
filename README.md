# Volterra Neural Networks (VNNs) - RKHS Implementation  

This repository extends and improves the codebase for [Volterra Neural Networks (VNNs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09616) and [Conquering the CNN Over-Parameterization Dilemma](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6870) by integrating **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)** representations to enhance Volterra filter implementations.  

As part of a research project at **CentraleSupÃ©lec**, this work explores and extends the theoretical and practical applications of VNNs within the RKHS framework. This approach provides a mathematically rigorous way to generalize Volterra filters, with potential improvements in **accuracy, efficiency, and model interpretability**.

## Key Features  

âœ… **RKHS-Based Volterra Filters** â€“ Novel implementation embedding Volterra filters into the RKHS framework.  
âœ… **Flexible Model Configurations** â€“ Support for **RGB, optical flow, and complex inputs** with adaptable architectures.  
âœ… **Improved Computational Efficiency** â€“ Real-time computation of optical flow, with optional **pre-computation for faster training**.  
âœ… **One-Time Video Preprocessing** â€“ Video frames are preprocessed once during the initial setup.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training  

1. **Set Dataset Paths** â€“ Update `mypath.py` with the correct dataset locations.  
2. **Choose Model Architecture** â€“ Configure your model in `train_VNN_fusion_highQ.py`. For **RKHS-based models**, use `networks/vnn_rkhs.py`.  
3. **Start Training**:  
   ```bash
   python3 train_VNN_fusion_highQ.py
   ```
4. **Preprocessing** â€“ On first execution, video frames will be preprocessed. This process **runs once** and speeds up subsequent training.

## RKHS Volterra Model Architecture  

The **RKHS-based implementation** extends traditional Volterra filters by embedding inputs into a **high-dimensional Hilbert space**, allowing for:  
- **Nonlinear interactions** modeled with kernel functions.  
- **Regularization and better generalization**, reducing the risk of overfitting.  
- **Enhanced adaptability** to complex datasets.  

ðŸ“Œ The RKHS-based model is implemented in:  
```plaintext
networks/vnn_rkhs.py
```
